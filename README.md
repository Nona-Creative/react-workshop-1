# Nona React Workshop
Each brach of this Repo coinsides with a particular step in the workshop. If you're stuck you may take a look at the branch for the current step you're doing for the solution. Try not to do this too often as you won't learn as much. To learn effectively you need to wrestle with the problem for a bit not just ctrl-c ctrl-v :/
